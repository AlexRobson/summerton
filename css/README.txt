Our CSS file(s) are generated from sass code (http://sass-lang.com/).  The
source files can be found in the "sass" directory, and can be compiled using
compass (http://compass-style.org/).

Just go to the main theme directory ("summerton"; the one above this
directory) and run `compass compile`.  If you are actively working on the
styling, you may want to use `compass watch`.

Configuration for compass is in "config.rb".  You probably want to change the
first two settings when finally deploying the site.
