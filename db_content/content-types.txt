Need to add a content type whose machine name is "raw".  This is for certain
special pages whose content needs to span the width of the page (eg: the
homepage, with its alternating colour blocks).

I called this "Special Page", and set the description to
  A page where free reign is needed over the content; in particular, the
  content will span the width of the page.
and the "Explanation or submission guidelines" to
  Note that you will need to wrap the actual content (text etc) in containers
  with the class .content-block, like &lt;div
  class="content-block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Don't forget to uncheck "Display author and date information" on the "Display
settings" tab, and set the default comment setting to "closed".

Also, you might want to edit the "Body" field to default to "Unfiltered HTML".
