* Header bar/menu bar: should it be positioned relative to window (ie: always
  stay visible as you scroll)?
* 3 different shades of red: brand red in most places, leader image text on
  home page ("Some charities help peoples 1000s...") slightly lighter, header
  button backgrounds lighter still.
* Leader image text on home page should not just be an image.
* In general, any image with text needs to have the alt attribute set.
* What should the maximum layout width be?  What, precisely, should be the
  behaviour when the browser is narrower?  Currently, the menu shrinks as much
  as it can, then goes to the bottom of the page.
* TESTING on other browsers!
* Footer placement on short pages; currently just becomes really tall.  Hard
  (impossible?) to force it to the bottom and keep the width responsive.
* What should the leader image on the home page (girl in scarf) do on
  super-wide screens?
* Textured image for footer (see TODO in components/_page.scss).
